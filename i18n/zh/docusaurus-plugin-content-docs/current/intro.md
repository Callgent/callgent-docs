# Introduction

**User-as-a-Service redefined**.

Callgent.com enables your users to be integrated into systems as normal functional services.

Based on this integration, system may call users asynchronously, with callback response;

Also users may call system services, just like chatting with friends.

## Benefits

Bridge all traditional gaps between systems and users:

- Users are always reachable from system point of view:
  - among business processes
  - on business or system exceptions
  - consistent programming experiences by including users as a service
- Easy and intelligent interaction with system from users point of view:
  - just like chatting with friends in a contextual group, powered by our progressing requesting technology
  - zero code development by just callgents and users orchestration
  - everyone may be a product manager
- Orchestrated services may be exposed any where, by polymorphic interface plugins:
  - as email address
  - in IM channels
  - on generative web pages
  - VR/AR, etc.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:4000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
