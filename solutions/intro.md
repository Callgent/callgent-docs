## User as a Service
We do have SAAS, IAAS, and PAAS, and their essence lies in taking Software, Infrastructure, and Platform as the vital tools for building software to fulfill our business demands. Hereinafter, we will present to you UaaS (User as a Service). UaaS is a fresh concept which allows users to construct software with the help of AI without having to write code. Actually, the task is fulfilled by another user behind the service, who responds to the task through either email or chat tools like Slack or via a rest-api or other scenarios.
