import CreateEndpoints from "@site/src/components/user-as-a-service/create-endpoints"
import CreateCallgent from "@site/src/components/user-as-a-service/create-callgent"
import ImportApi from "@site/src/components/user-as-a-service/import-api"
import Email from "@site/src/components/quick-start/email"
import CascadingMenu from "@site/src/components/tree"

Now let's create the `recruit` callgent, and import the API definition into the callgent.

## Create a new callgent

We can use the following widget to create a new callgent. A callgent contains a list of client endpoints and a list of server endpoints.

{/* <pre><CreateCallgent /></pre> */}
<CascadingMenu adaptorKey="Email" name="Recruitment" />

**Client endpoints** define a method that can be invoked by the user, we can have multiple client endpoints, like email type, restapi type, web type etc, system will auto generates email type and restapi type client endpoints.
Email and restapi are the basic comunicating type of the client endpoint. And we can also define advanced type like web type in the later examples.
1. The email type of client endpoint generates an email address for the user to send an email to in order to send the business request.
2. For the restapi type of client endpoint, you need to provide a predefined restful API definition which uses the OpenAPI specification. Then, you can invoke the restapi to send the business request.
3. The web type of client endpoint generates a web page for the user to send a web request to provide the business request.

For example we choose `web type client` endpoint here.

A **server endpoint** delineates methods that encapsulate and forward the request to the actual service used to accomplish your tasks.
In this case, we can use the `recruit` service endpoint to fullfill our tasks.

You may view all your callgents in the [Callgent Dashboard](https://app.callgent.com/dashboard) page.

## Create a service-endpoint
This callgent will be assigned an email address which is used to comunicate with the services for you, you can get the callgent email adress just like <Email />,
later you can send an email as a request to this address to accomplish your taks. And meanwhile a SEP(service-endpoint) will be created to connected to the your authorised services
