# Call the Callgent

import CreateCallgent from "@site/src/components/user-as-a-service/create-callgent"
import Email from "@site/src/components/quick-start/email"
import RestApi from "@site/src/components/quick-start/restApi"

Now you may request the callgent for a task, in the following ways.

## Email

You may directly send an email toï¼š<Email />

then wait for reply from the callgent's [Service Endpoint](#connect-the-callgent-to-a-service-endpoint).

:::tip
The email address and API url below, contains callgent UUID, which is available after you've [created the callgent](#create-a-new-callgent).
:::

## REST API

You may also invoke the callgent via REST API:
<RestApi/>


:::info
- `callback` parameter is essensial if you need to receive asyncronous response from callgent service.
:::

## Web Page

You may also generate a web page with a form or button to send a task to the callgent.

## Embed into more systems

For example, you may also want to connect the callgent to `Slack`, `Jira`, ..., Apps, so that colleagues can interact with the callgent in the channels;  
Or connect it to your personal Apps like `WhatsApp`, `Instagram`, to let the callgent assist you anywhere seamlessly.

This is achieved by adding more adaptive `Client Endpoint`s to the callgent, then do some neccessary configurations. You may learn more in the [Client Endpoint](../advanced-topics/callgent-endpoints/client-endpoint) section.
