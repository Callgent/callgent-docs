# Call the Callgent

import CreateCallgent from "@site/src/components/user-as-a-service/create-callgent"
import Email from "@site/src/components/quick-start/email"
import RestApi from "@site/src/components/quick-start/restApi"

Now you may request the callgent for a task, in the following ways.

## Email

You may directly send an email toï¼š<Email />

then wait for reply from the callgent's [Service Entry](#connect-the-callgent-to-a-service-entry).

:::tip
The email address and API url below, contains callgent Id, which is available after you've [created the callgent](#create-a-new-callgent).
:::

## REST API

You may also invoke the callgent via REST API:
<RestApi/>


:::info
- `callback` parameter is essensial if you need to receive asyncronous response from callgent services.
:::

## Web App

The most convenient way to interact with services, should be the [Callgentive UI](/blog/2024-06-17-generative-ui-home-cooked-software-development/generative-ui) way.
As user rquests, the callgent generates a web app which inter-weave to imported services.

:::info
Try it in the [next section](./build-web-app)!

## Embed into more systems

For example, you may also want to connect the callgent to `Slack`, `Jira`, ..., Apps, so that colleagues can interact with the callgent in the channels;  
Or connect it to your personal Apps like `WhatsApp`, `Instagram`, to let the callgent assist you anywhere seamlessly.

This is achieved by adding more adaptive `Client Entry`s to the callgent, then do some neccessary configurations. You may learn more in the [Client Entry](../advanced-topics/callgent-entries/client-entry) section.
