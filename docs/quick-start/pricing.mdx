:::

import SelectCallgent from "@site/src/components/module/select-callgent"

### 1. Select Your Callgent

<pre>
<SelectCallgent />
</pre>

### 2. Configure Authentication  
Set up authentication to ensure service security and specify who pays for the request. Different types of locks indicate different roles.

**Client Entries**: Used for identity verification. If the lock is open, the creator pays; if closed, the caller pays.

**Service Adaptors**: Indicate how the current request will be charged.

### Option 1: Per-Call Billing (Ideal for Beginners)  
Charge a fixed amount per API call. Suitable for standardized services.

- **Use Case**: Fixed, predictable query services  
- **Example**: $0.01 per call  
- **How to Set**: Simply input the amount in the pricing field

### Option 2: Per-Token Billing (Great for Content Services)  
Charge based on token usage. Best for dynamic content services like text generation or translation.

- **Use Case**: Services with variable-length output  
- **Example Code**:
```javascript
// Charge $0.0002 per token
function calcPrice(req) {
  return req.tokenUsage * 0.0002;
}
```

### 3. Enable Monetization  
Under the **test** section in the image above, find the newly imported API. Click the lock icon, choose your authentication method, and confirm the lock is closed to complete the setup.
