# Generate a Web APP

import CascadingMenu from "@site/src/components/tree"

Now we come to the most interesting part, let the callgent generate a web APP on the fly, with least effort!

## Define the APP functionalities

Firstly, we must know what the APP need do!  
There is no easier way to define APP functionalities than through Callgent.

You have the following methods to go:

### Import an existing 3rd-party services

There are more than enough existing services you may import to your callgent directly,  
You may find some on the [Callgent Hub](https://hub.callgent.com/)!  
Just find one appopriate callgent, then fork it as your own.  

:::tip
Of cause you may implement your own services, and share to others on the hub if want to. Yet this may require more programming skills.
:::

### User as a Service

Actually you needn't hire a programmar to code a service, you yourself can be part of the APP, to serve your users!

Follow <a href="/solutions/showcase/user-as-a-service/service-design" target="_blank">this example</a> to define a job hiring callgent service.

## Generate the Web pages

After you've defined the callgent serivices, now let's try callgent to generate web pages:

1. load your just defined `Job hiring callgent` by name
2. add a new `Webpage` client entry
3. open the entry, then ask some question, e.g. ""
4. wait for callgent to generate pages,

<pre> 
<CascadingMenu name="Recruitment" placeholder="Please enter the callgent name you just defined services" />
</pre>

## Consolidate pages into Web APP

It's not neccessary to generate pages every time.
You may convert them into normal Web APP, just save the generated pages.
The saved web APP is deployed automatically on callgent server.
Or you may export it to deploy anywhere you like.

:::tip
There are a default urls for callgent hosted web APPs.
You may bind your own host urls to your web APPs.
