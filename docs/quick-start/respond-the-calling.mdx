# Respond to the Calling

Callgent translates and relays client's calling to actual system service or users to execute.

Firstly you need to bind a service to the callgent.

## The default callgent service

By default, after you've created the callgent, YOU are the default 'service' responsible for reply to any client requests!

:::tip
By default, Any client request are sent to you via your registered account email on [callgent.com](https://www.callgent.com).
Just reply to the email, and the response will be relayed to the client by the Callgent.
